## üè∑Ô∏è Problem Statement

Retail food waste is a critical global issue. Every day, tons of perfectly edible food is discarded because it's nearing its expiry date‚Äîcontributing to **1.3 billion tons** of food waste annually.

This waste represents lost revenue, disposal costs, and severe environmental consequences (methane emissions, wasted resources). Consumers expect retailers to adopt sustainable practices and reduce waste as part of responsible business.

For Walmart, minimizing food waste isn‚Äôt just operational efficiency‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for brand trust, ESG targets, and leading the industry toward a sustainable future.
